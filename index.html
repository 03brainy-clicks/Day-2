        Sir Isaac Newton PRS was an English mathematician, physicist,
        astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and author widely recognised as one
        of the greatest mathematicians and physicists of all time and among the
        most influential scientists. He was a key figure in the philosophical
        revolution known as the Enlightenment.

          <h4>Newton's Schooling</h4>

          <p>
            Newton was born on January 4, 1643, in Lincolnshire, England. As a
            kid, he liked building models. He once built a tiny mill. It could
            grind real flour. It was even powered by a mouse running in a wheel.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 1661, Newton went to the University of Cambridge. At first, he
            did not stand out as a student. In 1665, the school closed for a
            time because of the bubonic plague. This deadly disease killed
            thousands of people.
          </p>

          <p>
            Newton went home for two years. This is when he got his
            apple-falling idea. In 1667, he went back to Cambridge and became a
            math teacher until 1696.
          </p>

        <div class="article article-2">
          <h4>Newton Changes Science Forever</h4>
          <p>
            The theory of gravity was just one of Newton's discoveries. He also
            loved calculus. This is a mathematical subject that studies rates. A
            rate is the measurement of how much something changes. Newton's
            ideas in calculus are still used today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Newton also studied optics, the science of light. He found out that
            white light is not just white. It is actually a mix of all the
            colors of the rainbow. Newton used his knowledge of light to make
            better telescopes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Following his apple idea, Newton wrote three laws of motion. These
            laws changed all of science, and are still used by scientists today.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="article article-3">
          <h4>First Law of Motion: Inertia</h4>

          <p>
            An object that sits still will remain still unless a force is
            applied to it. An object that is moving will keep moving along a
            straight line unless an outside force is applied to it.

        <h2>Thank you for Calculus.</h2>
        <p>
          And thank you for The Law of Universal Gravitation, it comes in handy.
          <br />
          Thank you for the First Law of Motion,<br />
          and the Second Law of Motion,<br />
          oh and of course the Third Law of Motion.<br />
          We won't forget the Reflecting Telescope,<br />
          or that "white light" is actually a spectrum of colors.
